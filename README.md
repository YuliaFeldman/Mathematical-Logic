# Mathematical-Logic

This project is an implementation of mathematical logical formulae and logical proofs as Python objects. <br />
In other words, this projects contains methods and functions that deal with Python objects like Formula and Proof.
For example, propositions/semantics.py file contains a function called is_tautology(formula) which determines if the given logical formula is a yautology, i.e., logically always true.

Created as part of INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL LOGIC FOR PROGRAMMING-ORIENTED STUDENTS 2020 course @ Hebrew University of Jerusalem
